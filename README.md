# HackerRank

This repository contains my submissions to [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/Airballman?hr_r=1).

I started solving problems on Hacker Rank as a way to get into Functional Programming so most solutions you will find here are written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).

* Chapters are ordered in folders
* I usually browse the leaderboard after having solved a new challenge. Classes that end in _Best_ are used to store a solution I found particularly elegant.


Happy reading, and solve your own challenges first before peaking here ;)
